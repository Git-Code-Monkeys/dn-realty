# Project Structure Documentation

This document outlines the structure of the project, explaining the purpose of each directory and its subdirectories.

## Root Level Directories

- **`.next`**: This directory is automatically generated by Next.js and contains the compiled and optimized production build of the application. It's not meant to be manually edited.
- **`.vscode`**: This directory holds workspace-specific settings for Visual Studio Code, such as recommended extensions (`extensions.json`), launch configurations for debugging (`launch.json`), and other editor preferences (`settings.json`).
- **`node_modules`**: This directory contains all the project's dependencies (npm packages) installed via `pnpm install`. It's managed by the package manager and should not be manually modified.
- **`public`**: This directory is used for serving static assets that don't require processing, such as images, fonts, and `favicon.ico`. Files in this directory are accessible from the root of the domain.
- **`src`**: This is the main directory containing the application's source code. All the logic, components, and configurations are located here.
- **`tests`**: This directory contains all the tests for the application, separated into end-to-end (`e2e`) and integration (`int`) tests.

## `src` Directory

The `src` directory is the heart of the application and is organized as follows:

- **`access`**: Contains functions that define access control rules for collections and endpoints. These functions determine who can perform what actions (e.g., read, create, update, delete) on the data.
- **`app`**: This directory is central to the Next.js App Router structure. It's divided into two main parts:
    - **`(frontend)`**: Contains the code for the public-facing part of the website. This includes pages, layouts, and components that make up the user interface.
    - **`(payload)`**: Contains the code related to the Payload CMS admin panel. This includes custom styles, layouts, and components for the admin interface.
- **`blocks`**: This directory contains reusable content blocks that can be dynamically assembled to create pages. Each block has its own component and configuration. Examples include `Banner`, `CallToAction`, and `Content` blocks.
- **`collections`**: Defines the data models (schemas) for the content managed by Payload CMS. Each file in this directory represents a collection, such as `Pages`, `Posts`, `Users`, and `Media`.
- **`components`**: Contains reusable React components that are used across the application. These components are generally presentation-focused and can be used in pages, blocks, or other components.
- **`endpoints`**: This directory is used to define custom API endpoints for the application. This is useful for creating specific server-side functionality that doesn't fit into the standard collection-based API.
- **`fields`**: Contains definitions for custom field types that can be reused in different collections. This helps to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.
- **`Footer`**: Contains the code for the website's footer, including its React component and Payload CMS configuration.
- **`Header`**: Contains the code for the website's header, including its React component, navigation, and Payload CMS configuration.
- **`heros`**: This directory contains different types of "hero" sections that can be used at the top of pages. Each hero has its own component and configuration.
- **`hooks`**: Contains custom React hooks and Payload CMS hooks. These hooks provide reusable logic and allow for extending the functionality of the application and the CMS.
- **`plugins`**: This directory is for integrating and configuring Payload CMS plugins.
- **`providers`**: Contains React context providers that supply global state or functionality to the application, such as theme management or authentication status.
- **`search`**: Contains the code related to the search functionality of the website.
- **`utilities`**: A collection of helper functions and utility modules that can be used throughout the application. These functions typically perform common tasks like formatting dates, generating URLs, or handling media.
